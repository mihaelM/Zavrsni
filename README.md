Autocomplete mechanism

I did this for my final work. I developed Android app with keyboard that has altrenative prediction mechanism (autocomplete).
It was compared with the standard prediction mechanism.
The final code is in MyKeyboardVol4 and it uses open source code CircularFloatingActionMenu-master under MIT licence.
The text (on Croatian) is in Zavrsni_Marovic.pdf.
You can install android app using the key-vol2.apk.
